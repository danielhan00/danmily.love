This project was made for my girlfriend and I's 1 year anniversary!

The theme was to make a 90's style retro website that showcases some of the most important moments from one year. 

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
